  <h3>The Digital Audio Workstation(DAW)</h3>
  <p>This is a timeline view of the song that allows you to see what components are as well as allow you to listen to your song as it is being built. There are also many components to the DAW:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Reset</li>
          <li>Play/Pause</li>
          <li>Mute</li>
          <li>Volume Slider</li>
          <li>Loop</li>
          <li>Toggle Metronome</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In order to run a script in the DAW and actually listen to what it sounds like you have to code some parts using fitMedia() and some musical clips. Then when you press RUN, if there are no errors you would be able to listen to the music you have composed</p>
