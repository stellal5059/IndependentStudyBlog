    <!--Reflection and Why Earsketch is useful-->
    <p id="Inspiration"> When creating this song my inspiration for this was to create something that I could possibly use for future products. I am interested in photography, Production and cinematography, learning how to use Earsketch benefits me in many ways because that
      means I have found the loophole to Copyright. I decided the style of song because I thought that if I were to play this for an older crowd how would they react.</p>
