# Planning out what to study

---

* Within the past week, I have browsed through many topics such as SASS and EarSketch. SASS is a more advanced version of CSS that enhances the thought of "work smarter, not harder"(Mr.Mueller). This method takes CSS to a whole new level, even though SASS was a very interesting topic, it wasn't exactly what I had wanted to study. Taking the time to think I decided that the topic I was going to study would be Earsetch, a tool used to make music through code.

# What is EarSketch

* EarSketch is a program that uses languages such as Python and/or JavaScript to create music using music files saved in the cloud. When i first loaded up Earsketch I was going to orignally create and learn with Python, however in class we never learned Python. Throughout the 4 years of the Software Engineering Program we have gone through many coding languages and one of them happened to be JavaScript.

# Some "A-ha" Moments I had

 While starting the tutorial on EarSketch there was intial code when you created a new page:

```
init();
setTempo(120);


finish();
```
 What this means is that initally when it starts it's going to run whatever is between the setTempo and finish, which i feel means that the 120 in the parenthesis is two minutes. I haven't gotten that far into my study to exactly know what that means, however that is my guess.

# Take-Away(s) / Strategies

 * Read closely, you can easily miss something important if you just skim it
 * Watch as many videos as you can, through the website and on youtube if you have to, someone talking it through could make more sense than you just reading
