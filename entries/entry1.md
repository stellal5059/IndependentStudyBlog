# Planning out what to study

---

* Within the past week, I have browsed through many topics such as SASS and EarSketch. SASS is a more advanced version of CSS that enhances the thought of "work smarter, not harder"(Mr.Mueller). This method takes CSS to a whole new level, even though SASS was a very interesting topic, it wasn't exactly what I had wanted to study. Taking the time to think I decided that the topic I was going to study would be Earsetch, a tool used to make music through code.

# What is EarSketch
---

* EarSketch is a program that uses languages such as Python and/or JavaScript to create music using music files saved in the cloud. When i first loaded up Earsketch I was going to orignally create and learn with Python, however in class we never learned Python. Throughout the 4 years of the Software Engineering Program we have gone through many coding languages and one of them happened to be JavaScript.
