# More Music & Back to the Basics

### Repetition

~Repetition refers to the repeated sounds or sequences in music, this is a big part shared within all kinds of music. As Humans we enjoy repetition; it’s how we draw listeners to the actual music; this is how we cause the “earworm”, by repeating a section such as the chorus, the more likely the song is to get stuck in their head

~The best part about repetition is that is will allow you to be more into the song rather than just listening. The more you listen to a song, the more you notice the small details and are more likely to get hooked in, as well as a good hook you need a good form of repetition to keep the listener interested.

#### Contrast

~ When working with Repetition you need to provide a balance, just like designing a website you need Contrast which is used to enhance music and bring new elements to the listeners attention. Contrast is usually created when changing between rhythm and instruments, using Transitions is important when creating contrast in a song.

### MORE TRANSITIONS!!!!
~Musical Transitions Include:

~ Snare Roll: sequence of snare drum hits, increasing the pitch 
and the amplitude 

~ Looping: Repeating a short part a few times before going onto a new part

~ Crossfading: Lowering one side, Increasing the other; used a lot when DJing and publicly remixing songs

~ Anacrusis: series of notes that lead into the first beat of a new section; to use this part you need to use the API function 
of:

`insertMediaSection(clipName,trackNumber,measureNumber,Start, End)`

## More about Debugging 

### Printing to the Console
~ Using the println() function is a good tool to use when debugging code; the console will most likely give you line number of the error and the type of error presented so there is a clear statement of what needs to be fixed.

### Steps to Debugging

~ I went over debugging a few times when creating these blog entries but it’s only because i can’t stress enough about how important it is to know what you're doing when fixing your code:
	
	~Reproduce your Error: Every time you run the code the same error will come up
	
	~Read the console for clues: the error type and the line number will give you clues as to what is wrong with the code overall.
	
	~Locate the error: EarSketch will give you the same error and if you get a line number check there before checking anywhere else in the code.
	
	~SQUASH THE BUG: TERMINATE THE ERROR!

~If you can’t find and squash the bug the best thing to do is to ask for help, Two heads are better than one.

~A Big part to debugging is using the Console; this will display information to the user
Syntax for console input = `readInput()`

## RANDOMNESS
~ Including randomness into your music creates more of an “in the moment” feel

~ A random number is generated with `Math.random()`

	~Math.random()*number: This will generate a random number from 0 and the number being multiplied
	
	~Math.floor() rounds the random number to the nearest whole number

~Putting them together: Math.floor(Math.random()*number)

Generates the random number and random sound when you press run, there will be a new song and create that “in the moment” feel

# PEER FEEDBACK

~ Exchanging information between you and someone else provides a nice opportunity to learn from each other 

~ In Programming: Peer Feedback allows you to make improvements to functionality, clarity and correctness of the code

~ For Music it allows you to get another person’s opinion on the form, pace, track, sound and effects before letting the rest of the world listen to it.

~ Constructive Feedback is the most helpful

# Take-Aways
Work with others, you’ll achieve more rather than working alone and who knows maybe you sharing your ideas can benefit the other person also Two heads 
are better than one

USE THE CONSOLE! SQUASH THE BUG!, Debugging is very important this goes back to working with others, it’s okay to ask for help when you don’t understand something or if you’re stuck on a part
