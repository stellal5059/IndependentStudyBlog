## What to make

~ I wasn’t sure what to make at first so I decided to put together two of the coolest things I have learned with code, making websites and creating music.Throughout the entire Software engineering course we have been really expanding our knowledge, our prior knowledge before these past 8 weeks have prepared me greatly for this moment. With my new and previous knowledge of software engineering i have decided to make a website that plays music when the user interacts with it. 

~ Each of the sounds that the user hears will be a small clip of what i have created and will lead to a final song that i have created using Earsketch. There is still a lot to do to finish this project so that is what all of my time will be dedicated to.

## How I plan to do this?

~ While looking back through my notes from the previous year, there were notes about how to embed media into websites, I thought that instead of just having them there as play buttons, why not place them in a way where it makes the website more interactive. Using knowledge from previous years and this year will be useful when creating this product.

## Take Aways

~ When creating your final product use more than what you have learned over these past 8 weeks. This will benefit you because you will get more practice and your product should be something that you want to show to the world and something that you are proud of. So think what can you make on your own that you will be proud of.

~ You don’t have to work alone, find someone who is doing something similar you can put your ideas and products together to make one giant product. This goes back to the post where I said Two heads are better than one
